1) First, get a CVS of the Mozilla code.
2) Locate the root store: certdata.txt. Switch to that directory.
3) Extract the revisions with parse-revisions.
4) Extract rootstore by revision with create_certdata_by_rev.sh
5) Use rh's extended version of agl's script to extract from
the octal code.
6) Count over BEGIN CERTIFICATE per root store using count_certs_in_root_store.py
7) Make adjustments: the script will complain in some cases about
invalid certs or trust objects. These are acceptable to NSS, but
not to the scripts.
Known revs:
1.10 and 1.11 contain bad trust objects - count as TRUSTED
1.81-? contain a cert with a negative serial number - count as TRUSTED
